## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Project Structure

* The project follows a monorepo structure with two main directories: `/frontend` and `/backend`.

### Backend Structure
* The backend uses a standard MVC-like pattern (Models, Routes, Controllers) to organize logic.

### Frontend Structure
* The frontend is organized by feature, with components, hooks, and state management (stores) co-located.

    cd Real-Time-Chat-Application
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend:**
    * Navigate to the backend directory:
        ```sh
        cd backend
        npm install
        ```
    * Create a `.env` file in the `/backend` directory.

## ‚öôÔ∏è API Endpoints & Sockets

### REST API

The backend provides the following RESTful API endpoints. All protected routes are secured by JWT middleware.

#### Auth Routes (Base: `/api/auth`)
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `POST` | `/signup` | Register a new user. |
| `POST` | `/login` | Authenticate a user and return a JWT. |
| `POST` | `/logout` | Log out the current user. |
| `PUT` | `/profile-update` | Update the logged-in user's profile. |
| `GET` | `/check` | Validate the current JWT and return user details. |

#### Message Routes (Base: `/api/messages`)
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `GET` | `/contacts` | Fetch all available contacts. |
| `GET` | `/chats` | Retrieve chat partners for the logged-in user. |
| `GET` | `/:id` | Get all messages exchanged with a specific user. |
| `POST` | `/send/:id` | Send a new message to a specific user. |

### WebSocket Events
Socket.IO is used for all real-time communication.

* `connect`: Establishes a real-time connection[cite: 348].
* `send_message`: Broadcasts a message to a specific recipient.
* `receive_message`: Client-side listener for incoming messages.
* `typing`: Broadcasted when a user starts typing.
* `stopTyping`: Broadcasted when a user stops typing.

## üß™ Testing

The application's core features were tested manually and with API tools.

* **Backend API Testing:** Used **Postman** to test all REST API endpoints (`/register`, `/login`, `/messages`). Validated correct status codes (200, 400, 401) and message persistence in MongoDB.
* **WebSocket Testing:** Used Postman's WebSocket tool or a similar Socket.io tester to verify real-time event flow (`sendMessage`, `receiveMessage`).
* **Frontend Manual Testing:** Conducted full user-flow testing: Register -> Login -> Send Message -> Receive Message -> Logout. Verified responsiveness on mobile and desktop views and checked that online/offline indicators updated correctly.

## üîê Security Features

Security was a core consideration for this project.

* **Password Hashing:** User passwords are never stored in plaintext. They are hashed using **bcrypt** before being saved to the database.
* **JWT Authentication:** All protected routes are secured using middleware that verifies a **JSON Web Token (JWT)** passed from the client.
* **Secure HTTP Headers:** The **Helmet** library is used in Express to set various secure HTTP headers, protecting against common web vulnerabilities like XSS and clickjacking.
* **API Rate Limiting:** The **Arcjet** service is implemented to prevent brute-force attacks and API abuse by limiting the number of requests from a single IP.
* **Database Indexing:** Indexes are applied to `senderId` and `receiverId` in the Messages collection to ensure fast query performance and prevent slow, blocking queries as the database scales.

---

## üìà Future Enhancements

The following features are planned for future development:

* **Message Pagination:** Implement infinite scroll on the chat window to fetch message history in pages (`limit` and `page` queries) instead of all at once, improving performance for long conversations.
* **UI Animations:** Integrate **Framer Motion** to add smooth animations for new messages appearing, tab switching, and page transitions.
* **Loading Skeletons:** Implement loading skeletons that mimic the UI layout while data (contacts, chat history) is being fetched to improve perceived performance.
